Welcome to Inccorpco, a free photo sharing website. You can use this to store or create photo albums, create stock photos for public use, and edit your photos. 



<!--Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
